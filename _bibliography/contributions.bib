	title = {Dipole collision and energy dissipation in 2D Unitary Fermi Gases and BCS},
	author = {Barresi, A. and Boulet, A.},
	journal ={Bulletin of the American Physical Society},
	volume = {66},
	year = {2021},
	abstract = {We study propagation and collisions of vortex dipoles and quadrupoles in fermionic superfluids, both weakly and strongly interacting. The aim of the research is to explore the impact of the fermionic nature of the system on the dynamics of the vortices. The effects generated by Andreev states, localized within the cores, on dissipative processes will be discussed. Finally, results of exploratory large-scale simulations of many vortex dynamics in 2D their link to turbulence will be presented. },
