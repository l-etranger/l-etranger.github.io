As a theoretical physicist, my research interests are primarily focused on quantum many-body problems and development of *ab initio*, i.e. from first principle, density functional theories with applications to nuclear and atomic physics.

**Currently**  
I am a research assistant professor in the Nuclear Theory Group at the Warsaw University of Technology under the direction of [Gabriel Wlazłowski](http://wlazlowski.fizyka.pw.edu.pl/) and [Piotr Magierski](http://www.if.pw.edu.pl/~magiersk).
I extended the superfluid local density approximation and am currently investigating vortices, Higgs modes, and other collective behavior aspects related to superfluitity in many-body systems.

**Previously**  
I worked with [Scott Bogner](https://nscl.msu.edu/directory/bogner.html) and [Witek Nazarewicz](https://nscl.msu.edu/directory/witek.html) in the theory group of FRIB/NSCL at Michigan State University as a research associate.
I was working on the development of microscopically motivated DFT using *ab initio* theories and their implementation for large‑scale calculations of nuclei.
Since 2019, I have held a doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Paris-Saclay.
Prepared at IPN Orsay and supervised by [Denis Lacroix](https://sites.google.com/view/lacroixhomepage), the thesis was entitled *Density Functional Theory for Fermi systems with large s‑wave scattering length: application to atomic and nuclear physics*.
